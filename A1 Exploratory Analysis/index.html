			<h2>Subtheme: Understanding the factors and variables that lead to overdoses in the Pittsburgh area.</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>What factors lead to overdose deaths?</li>
				<li>What demographics are most likey to pass away from overdoses and from what?</li>
				<li>Is there data to help us predict what we can do to mitigate these risks?</li>
				<li>What are groups that are effected that might be surprising? </li>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

One of the insights I gathered from this is that there is similarity between sexes that Fentanyl is at the top and cocaine is next. I think this is helpful in understnading that there does not seem to be an obvious difference between sexes of what type of drug is more lethal for example. " />

I also tried using a map, but I thought it was less successful than this bar chart in explaining the difference between the drugs and zip codes (I found little difference)

I think this warrants further investigation into specific causes such as prevalence of fentanyl which has become a substantial killer over the years." />

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>Some data were more surprising than others. I was personally most surprised about 
                he overdoses that happen at 0 years old for example. This is something that I did not
                 think of before looking at the data and assumed that there might be an error in how I was displaying it.
                  I am also surprised at the apparent lack of data for people that are not white or black. 
                  Perhaps this can be explained partially to the general demographics of Pittsburgh. 
                  Overall, this has helped me get an overview of what the data means and how this might 
                  be able to inform decision making. There are also charts that I have included that do 
                  not necessarily show too much such as the location map example which has helped me 
                  realize where I might find certain insights in the data </p>
